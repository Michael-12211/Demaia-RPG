print_-1_0_I've never seen you around here before, what brings you here?
print_12_0_I'm a nomad. 'means I travel alot. Don't keep one home
print_-1_2_I know what a nomad is. I was just wondering what you were doing
print_12_0_Ah. whittling
print_-1_5_Ok, that I don't know about. What's whittling?
print_12_0_Wood carving. I make doodads to trade for resources I need.
print_-1_0_Interesting
print_12_0_Anything you think you'd need?
print_-1_2_Well, I currently have this old cudgel that I've been using to defend myself
print_-1_1_Think you might be able to do something better?
print_12_5_It's a blunt stick, what do you expect me to do?
print_-1_0_Give me a sharp stick?
print_12_5_...
print_-1_2_Yeah...
print_-1_0_Well, what about that wood-carving knife you have there? Any spares?
print_12_0_Yes, as it happens, but I'll need something in return.
print_-1_0_How much?
print_-1_2_Money's a little tight at the moment, so, I can't go too high
print_12_0_That's fine, I don't fancy cash much myself. Always perferred bartering.
print_-1_4_Oh, in that case, what do you want me to get you? My family owns a farm.
print_12_0_Nah, I can trade for foods whenever, I want something special.
print_-1_5_Oh... what?
print_12_0_I'm looking for a good pelt. 'fashion myself new clothes.
print_-1_2_Uhm... you're naked
print_12_0_I enjoy the option
print_12_0_'Sides, climate's changing. The northern reaches of Demaia's getting colder.
print_-1_2_I hadn't noticed
print_12_0_It's subtle, only just started, but it's happening, and I want to be prepared
print_-1_0_Hence the pelt for insulation?
print_12_0_Exactly.
print_12_0_Bring me a large, mammal pelt, and I'll give you my spare knife. Deal?
print_-1_1_deal!
print_12_5_Wait... you probably can't skin the hide, can you?
print_-1_2_Well, not without the knife.
print_12_5_In that case, just kill it and bring it to me. I'll skin it myself.
print_12_0_Actually, you dragging the massive carcasse across the forest floor will ruin it...
print_12_0_You know what? Just tell me where it is and I'll fly over to it myself.
print_-1_0_Then how will you know I'm not just lying to you?
print_12_5_I'll be able to tell if you just killed a massive beast.
print_-1_2_ok...
print_-1_1_I'll secure you your pelt and be back as soon as I'm done.

print_-1_1_Good morning, Mrs. Clarke!
print_13_1_Well, good morning to you, too.
print_-1_0_Mind if I ask you something?
print_13_1_Anything you need to ask is fine with me
print_-1_0_We got an envelope telling us that shipments to the mainland have stopped
print_-1_7_You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
print_13_5_Yes actually, we got the same notice
print_13_0_but we didn't get a reason,
print_13_5_Or really anything at all.
print_-1_2_Yeah, same...
print_13_0_If you want to know more, I recommend asking around lealet village up north.
print_13_1_Esmond's up there trying to peddle his alchemy, you should say hi.
print_-1_1_Yeah, he's always talking about that stuff...
print_-1_2_All that magi-bable just goes over my head
print_13_5_Alchemy isn't exactly magic, it's all... elements and compounds
print_-1_0_All the same to me, magic isn't my strong suit anyways.
print_-1_8_Sure I've apparently got some "natural perpencity" nonesense
print_-1_2_not that it matters with how little I can actually do with it.
print_13_1_Well, I'm sure you can do something, everyone's got gift of some kind
print_13_1_I myself am quite handy with the ol' shadowflame
print_-1_1_Yeah, sure,
print_-1_2_but the most I can do is just make a wad of... stuff
print_13_0_Is it solid?
print_-1_5_yeah?
print_13_1_you could always just throw it, give pests a good...

print_-1_1_You comming?
print_13_0_Sorry. As much as I'd love to check in on my son, I have to stay here
print_-1_4_Oh, why?
print_13_5_My husband was called down to Raustock to deal with an immigration concern
print_13_5_He was only supposed to be down for a few days, but he's running late
print_-1_0_Think it might be related to the exports?
print_13_5_I highly doubt it
print_13_0_Either way, I'll stay here and look after the farm

print_-1_2_no.
check_8_=_0
print_-1_7_What are you doing alone in the forest?
print_14_0_As it happens, I'm a researcher.
print_-1_0_Oh, then what are you studying?
print_14_0_Mushrooms. Poisonous ones to be percise.
print_-1_2_There are poisonous mushrooms growing in lealet outskirts?
print_14_2_Only a few, appearently. I came to check them out, but can't find any
print_-1_0_Would you need help finding some? I know this area...
print_-1_2_...somewhat well.
print_14_7_I.. I guess I could use some help.
print_14_2_though you should be careful, I don't know how dangerous they are
print_-1_8_Yeah, that's a given.
print_14_0_Okay then, safety basics...
print_14_2_handle from the top, avoid areas you can't see
print_14_2_touch only with fingertips, minimize skin contact.
print_-1_5_You have many more of these?
print_14_0_Yes. Plenty.

print_14_2_hmm
print_14_2_that's disapointing
print_14_2_we have this same breed back on Demaia
print_-1_5_so this was worthless?
print_14_0_no, I wouldn't say that
print_14_1_the knowledge that the spores managed to cross here has value
print_14_7_though I was hoping for a bit more
print_-1_0_then are you just going to head out of the woods?
print_14_2_no, actually, my boat's been delayed a few days, so I'm in no rush.
print_-1_4_I thought the issue was only with external travel!
print_14_0_It is, but there is so much confusion at the docks, well...
print_14_2_the ship got delayed.
print_-1_5_In that case, I guess have fun
print_14_0_Actually before you leave,
print_14_0_it's only fair you get something for your efforts
print_14_2_...
print_14_7_I actually don't have much on me beyond research equipment
print_14_0_I guess you can keep the mushroom?
print_-1_5_Gee. Thanks
print_14_0_Don't be so hard on it, it is great for compost heaps.
print_14_2_Just don't get too close to you or anyone's face.
print_14_2_Breathing in the those spores can be dangerous.
