print_-1_4_really? What's the occasion?
print_11_0_Trust me, it's not a good one
print_10_2_We got a letter in the mail. Supposedly, exports to the mainland have halted.
print_10_2_The letter didn't explain why
print_11_0_So, now only a few days from the harvest we've lost most customers
print_10_2_It's not like we'll go hungry, the harvest seems strong
print_11_0_but we'll be short on Gilberts, and that won't end well
print_-1_5_Oh, well, that's not good
print_-1_2_That's actually really bad.
print_-1_5_At least the eggs are nice
print_10_1_Yes. They'll be done in a few minutes
print_11_0_Meanwhile, Mind if I ask you a favor?
print_-1_0_Sure, what?
print_11_0_Just go out back and bash a couple squirrels, alright?
print_11_0_Money's tight, so we'll need the ensure the harvest goes as well as possible.
print_11_0_Just keep them off the trees, atleast
print_-1_0_Sure thing...
print_-1_2_...I guess.

print_-1_2_Is it really that important, dad? Seems like beurocracy to me
print_11_0_It's beurocracy that threatens our livelyhood, so yes.
print_11_3_The least they could do would be to give a reason!
print_-1_0_If this an issue for us, It's probably and issue for everyone else.
print_-1_0_I could just head to The Rostons and ask if they know anything.
